## Update 

Added method to reset attendance time range in Django Admin page.

This is present in Django Admin -> Attendance (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/info/attendanceclass/).  
Start Date: Start Date of Attendance period  
End Date: End Date of Attendance period

This will delete all present attendance data and create new attendance objects for the given time range.
